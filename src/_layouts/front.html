                    MapTop is mapping software for designers.
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Ever wanted to incorporate a map into your design but got
                    frustrated by the complicated software used by GIS professionals?
                    Me too. That's why we're building MapTop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With MapTop, you'll be able to easily create and style maps
                    for use in your work.
                </p>

                    <div class="front__section">
                        <h3>
                            <svg><use xlink:href="#icon-database" /></svg>
                            Import Data
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Quickly load CSV files into MapTop to build beautiful
                            choropleth and dot maps. You bring the data and we'll
                            do the rest.
                        </p>

                    <div class="front__section">

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            With MapTop, you can easily customize your maps, adjusting
                            color themes and tweaking map attributes. If you've
                            ever used a graphics editing program, you'll be right
                            at home here.
                        </p>

                    <div class="front__section">
                        <h3>
                            <svg><use xlink:href="#icon-share" /></svg>
                            Export Your Map
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Once your map is complete, you'll want to be able to
                            export it out of MapTop for use in your websites or
                            other documents. We save our data out as standard SVG files,
                            so you can take your design further however you want.
